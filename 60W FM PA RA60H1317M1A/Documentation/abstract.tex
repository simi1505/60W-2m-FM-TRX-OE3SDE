	This 60W 144MHz FM Power Amplifier is the perfect "Add-On" for my previously released 1W 144MHz FM Transceiver. This power amplifier adds 30dB gain in the TX-Path and a lot of important analog RF filtering. Furthermore, the RX-Path is amplified with a gain of 23dB and is filtered with high order filters to improve the signal noise ration for better understanding of the other transmitters.
	All RX / TX signals are switched with PIN diodes to avoid expensive radio frequency shielded relais.
